# beam-dataflow-demo
This repository contains the code used in the demo of the "Apache Beam y la unificación del desarrollo para Big Data" presentation by José Luis Sánchez.

Coded by Roberto Veral (and José Luis Sánchez, of course).

By the time this demo was done the Apache Beam project was in an early stage (without any release), so the code is done with the Dataflow SDK and the Cloudera Spark Runner (which are sitting together in Beam).

In the code there are some transformations that have been rewritten to adapt to the current runner, beacuse of the early stage of the Spark Runner.
